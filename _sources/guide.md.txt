# Guide for instructors and contributors


## Presentation style

When presenting the material we use the collaborative notes a lot and we use
the example repository to show the concepts in practice.

Code review is the central tool to introduce and discuss changes.

For any change we create a new branch and we encourage creating new branches.

The presenter can either work within the example repository or fork it.  We
encourage participants to fork the repository and work on their own fork.

We encourage participants to open issues and send pull requests but the course
assumes that some participants will only follow.


## Preparation

Prepare a collaborative notes document which will be the central entry point.

Prepare the example repository. During the course the repository will receive
pull requests and merged and before the next course it may need to be reset to
the initial state (screenshot below).
