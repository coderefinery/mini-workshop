# CodeRefinery mini-workshop


## Goals of this workshop

- We will together create a simple image processing pipeline that is reproducible, reusable, extensible, documented, and tested.
- We will start with something relatively simple and gradually add the missing pieces: all the way towards making it publishable.
- We will use a Python example but we will not need Python experience and not
  focus on Python programming but rather on software development practices.


## Learner personas

- You write code for their own research: alone or in a small collaboration.
- You want to be able to contribute to open-source projects.
- You use code written by others in a Jupyter Notebook (or similar) or a script.
- You neither write not use code but you want to better understand how reproducible research software is created and what matters to make it reusable.
